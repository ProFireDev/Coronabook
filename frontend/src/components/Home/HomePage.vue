                    <p>Coronabook is a Organization Aimed at helping medical professionals , and other frontline workers get the supplies that they need, in order to be safe. We run off a collection of dedicated volunteers who help us distribute things like masks, food and other supplies to workers and families in need. We are the collective of people that are enabling families to have the ability to stay home and in doors. Aside from medical workers we work with schools to get internet and technology to students in need, so they can have better opportunities and a better education, while they are away from school. We also help develiver things to the vernatube through some of our partner organizations, like the Calgary food bank and meals on wheels.</p>
