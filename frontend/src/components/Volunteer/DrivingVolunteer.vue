                CoronaBook is a non-profit organization whose goal is to connect and transport medical materials that are needed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the rapid spread of the virus hospitals and medical centers struggle to provide and have the necessary materials needed to help the patients. That is why with our website hospitals and pharmacies input the amount of stock they have and are able to ask and give other medical centers for materials. That way the community is able to support and help to “flatten the curve”.
